Final Project for Python Class


A simple application that helps users to choose food ingridients to prepare a meal. The application first takes users' body measurements and diet preferences, which are used to calculate meal calories and macro nutritions need. The app then searches for food items in USDA database to generate a randomized meal for users. The calories and macro nutritions of the food selected would add up to meet users' energy and nutrition need. The users can easily generate new random meals by hitting a 'again' button.
